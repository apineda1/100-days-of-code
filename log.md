# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Forked two repos in GitHub, studied how git works using TwilioQuest. Finished part of day to of Advent of Code.

**Thoughts:** I want to fully understand how git works, and I want to finish Advent of Code for this challenge.

### Day 2: September 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched a ton of videos on the introductory course of Python in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I know I said I wanted to make Advent of Code, but I do believe I could use some basic practice. So I will grind my way through the python courses in FreeCodeCamp from the beginning. Some of the videos are really basic, but others have concepts I didn't know about. I won't look at how many videos I have left, I will just watch them all through. I will eventually reach the projects, I will complete those and continue with Data Science. Eventually, I want to learn JavaScript, but I do believe that will be for another itearation of this 100 day challenge, not this one.
