# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Forked two repos in GitHub, studied how git works using TwilioQuest. Finished part of day to of Advent of Code.

**Thoughts:** I want to fully understand how git works, and I want to finish Advent of Code for this challenge.

### Day 2: September 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched a ton of videos on the introductory course of Python in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I know I said I wanted to make Advent of Code, but I do believe I could use some basic practice. So I will grind my way through the python courses in FreeCodeCamp from the beginning. Some of the videos are really basic, but others have concepts I didn't know about. I won't look at how many videos I have left, I will just watch them all through. I will eventually reach the projects, I will complete those and continue with Data Science. Eventually, I want to learn JavaScript, but I do believe that will be for another itearation of this 100 day challenge, not this one.

### Day 3: September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched 15% more of Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp. Forked first project.

**Thoughts**: I know that today I didn't technically code, but I want to be able to finish the things and I begun this course, I want to finish it. My plan is to do 15% of videos on weekdays and 25% on Satudarday and Sunday. That way, I will finish the instructional part soon enough to go to coding projects at the end of the class. If I ever feel lost, I can always go back. I also forked the first project I will have to make.

### Day 4: September 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another 15% through Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I am excited about the next lesson on creating a web browser. We already covered all the basics, and now we are going to see real world applications. Regular expressions for string manipulation actually caught my eye and I think they are worth looking at. I am happy with my progress with the videos. I believe that by the end of the week, I will be working on real projects. 

### Day 5: September 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 71% through Python for Everybody. Almost finished with arithmetic_arranger.

**Thoughts**: I was actually excited to understand more about ASCII, UTF-8, XML, JSON... The lessons made me think that I could program my own module to access the World Bank Data and other databases. The video lessons were short today, but I felt like coding the first challenge. What's left is the arrangement part, I have to think like a machine to do this. I believe my code is a little too clumsy, but I am ok with clumsy, as I am still learning.

### Day 6: September 25, 2020

**Today's progress**: 91% through Python for Everybody.

**Thoughts**: I would like to understand more about APIs. I also want to overcome my fear of SQL and finally understand how to use it to create databases and incorporate it in my python code. Particularly, I want to be able to tell when to use pandas and when to use SQL.

### Day 7: September 26, 2020

**Today's progress**: 100% through Python for Everybody. Finished Arithmetic Arranger. Started Time Calculator.

**Thoughts**: I finished watching Python for Everybody, and I should admit that there are things that weren't completely clear, but I do believe that exposure is important and what really makes me learn how to code is the projects I am working on. I am proud of finishing a course. Now only the projects are left. Time Calculator is cracking my head open, trying to figure out how to calculate time and date without importing the time and date module. But I will succeed, I know I need while loops.

### Day 8: September 27, 2020

**Today's progress**: First successful call to an API. Started doing Object Oriented Programming.

**Thoughts**: I may have spent way too much time on this project, but I finally have my first OOP draft, or that is how I am calling it.

### Day 9: September 30, 2020
**Today's progress**: Worked on creating links for each social media account.

**Thoughts**: This is taking me longer than I expected.

**Today's progress**: Finished second iteration of my zoom planner. Made the final Copies class, to create the copies for social media.

**Thoughts**: What I believe is the positive outcome of this project is

### Day 11: October 6, 2020

**Today's progress**: Read on how to do SQL queries.

### Day 12: October 8, 2020
**Today's progress**: First javascript map using Folium.

**Thoughts**: I need to learn javascript. Forget about websites, I need beautiful graphics.

### Day 13: October 9, 2020
**Today's progress**: Added colors and first marker to chart. 

**Thoughts**: I am worst at keeping track of my progress than at making progress.

### Day 14: October 10, 2020

**Today's progress**:Added the rest of the markers to the map. Finished HTML basics in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I should've studied this at college, maybe. I am really enjoying myself. I like setting classes in CSS for some reason, it appeals to my sense of needing order. I wonder if VIM is good website development. I want to learn more about VIM.s

### Day 15: October 11, 2020

**Today's progress**: Finished Area Calculator project and Basic CSS in FreeCodeCamp. Activate vim in repl.it to get used to it.

**Thoughts**: I want to learn web design just for the sake of the pretty graphics and to be able to do things that people will find beautiful.
