# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Forked two repos in GitHub, studied how git works using TwilioQuest. Finished part of day to of Advent of Code.

**Thoughts:** I want to fully understand how git works, and I want to finish Advent of Code for this challenge.

### Day 2: September 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched a ton of videos on the introductory course of Python in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I know I said I wanted to make Advent of Code, but I do believe I could use some basic practice. So I will grind my way through the python courses in FreeCodeCamp from the beginning. Some of the videos are really basic, but others have concepts I didn't know about. I won't look at how many videos I have left, I will just watch them all through. I will eventually reach the projects, I will complete those and continue with Data Science. Eventually, I want to learn JavaScript, but I do believe that will be for another itearation of this 100 day challenge, not this one.

### Day 3: September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched 15% more of Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp. Forked first project.

**Thoughts**: I know that today I didn't technically code, but I want to be able to finish the things and I begun this course, I want to finish it. My plan is to do 15% of videos on weekdays and 25% on Satudarday and Sunday. That way, I will finish the instructional part soon enough to go to coding projects at the end of the class. If I ever feel lost, I can always go back. I also forked the first project I will have to make.

### Day 4: September 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another 15% through Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I am excited about the next lesson on creating a web browser. We already covered all the basics, and now we are going to see real world applications. Regular expressions for string manipulation actually caught my eye and I think they are worth looking at. I am happy with my progress with the videos. I believe that by the end of the week, I will be working on real projects.
